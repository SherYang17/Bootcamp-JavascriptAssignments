// In cartApp.js, write a script that does the following:
// Create a function called initializeCart that checks if there's a cart in localStorage; if not, it initializes an empty cart and stores it in localStorage.
function initializeCart() {
    
  }

// Create a function called addItem that takes an item object as a parameter, retrieves the cart from localStorage, adds the item to the cart, and then stores the updated cart back into localStorage.
function addItem(item) {
   
  }

// Create a function called removeItem that takes an item id as a parameter, retrieves the cart from localStorage, removes the item with the given id from the cart, and then stores the updated cart back into localStorage.
function removeItem(itemId) {

  }

// Create a function called displayCart that retrieves the cart from localStorage and logs the cart contents to the console.
function displayCart() {
   
  }


// Create event listeners for the add item form and display cart button to call the respective functions.
